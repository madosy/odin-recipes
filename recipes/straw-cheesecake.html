    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Put strawberries and sugar in a pot and boil until thickened, then add lemon juice and mix, sift through a sieve, put in another bowl and cool.</li>
            <li>Add melted unsalted butter to the crushed digestive cookies, mix, place in a 15cm mold, press flat to shape, and place in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Add 1 sheet of gelatin to cold water and soak for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Soften the cream cheese that has softened at room temperature, add sugar and vanilla extract and mix, then add lemon juice and mix.</li>
            <li>Squeeze out the water from the gelatin and heat it in the microwave for about 15 seconds to melt it completely, mix, then add the cooled strawberry puree and mix.</li>
            <li>Whip the whipped cream until the horns start to rise, then add it to the cheesecake batter and mix.</li>
            <li>Pour about 1/5 of the dough (about 140g) into the mold, flatten it, and let it harden in the freezer for 15 minutes. Add a little red food coloring to the remaining dough and mix to color.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4 of the remaining cheesecake batter over the hardened cheesecake, flatten it and harden it in the freezer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Repeat to harden the cheesecake to a dark color, pour the last dough and flatten it, and let it harden in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Wrap the mold with a steam towel to melt it slightly, remove the mold, smooth the sides, and decorate the top with strawberries.</li>
        </ol>
